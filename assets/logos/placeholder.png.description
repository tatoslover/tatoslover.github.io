Since you don't have direct image creation tools available, this file serves as a placeholder description.

To create the actual placeholder.png image:
1. Download a simple placeholder icon (circular with generic icon inside)
2. Save it as placeholder.png in the test/assets/logos directory
3. Make sure it's approximately 200x200 pixels with a transparent background
4. The image should be consistent with the placeholder.svg we created

Alternatively, you can convert the SVG to PNG using an online tool or with a command like:
`convert placeholder.svg placeholder.png`
